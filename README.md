Insights & recommendation -
The top four states promoting maximum sales and profit are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Delhi.

Clothing category is the most popular for shopping, followed by Electronics and Furniture. Offering exciting discounts, coupons, and offers can attract customers and improve sales in these categories.

The months of January, March, August, October, and November generate the highest profit. Introducing seasonal collections and providing relevant offers, coupons, and discounts during these months can boost sales.

Harivansh, Madhav, Madan Mohan, Shiva, and Vishakha are frequent customers who contribute significantly to sales and profit. Rewarding them with gifts, discount coupons, and special offers can attract other customers to the store.

Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most preferred mode of payment. Offering COD as a payment option for every product can enhance customer convenience.

Profitable sub-categories within Electronics, Furniture, and Clothing include printers, bookcases, and sarees. The best results were achieved in Quarter 1 and Quarter 4.
